	abstract = {This research paper discusses the impacts on the global economy and international market affected by the {US} and China trade war, which started in 2018-19. Led by the previous president of the {US}, Donald Trump, succeeded by the current president Joe Biden, trade protectionism was brought out to restrict Chinese exports to the {US}. Due to political, social, economic, and many other factors, both {US} and China ended up imposing additional tariffs on each other’s imports and setting up more and more restrictions on the international market. These imposed trade barriers between the two major economies in the world significantly influenced the two countries themselves, other bystander economies, and the international market balance. The paper discusses and reveals how the economic conflict affects {US} and China, both consequences and benefits, and how some countries found opportunities from this conflict, and some resulted in losses. Suggestions for possible solutions which each government can take are also being explained.},

	abstract = {Starting in early 2018, the U.S. government imposed tariffs on over \$300 billion of U.S. imports from China, increasing the average tariff rate from 2.7 percent to 17.5 percent. Much of the escalation in tariffs occurred in the second and third quarters of 2019. In response, the Chinese government retaliated, increasing the average tariff applied on U.S. exports from 5.7 percent to 20.4 percent. Our new study finds that the trade war reduced U.S. investment growth by 0.3 percentage points by the end of 2019, and is expected to shave another 1.6 percentage points off of investment growth by the end of 2020. In this post, we review our study of the trade war’s effect on U.S. investment.},
